Q1  What is the meaning of “Index” or “Staging Area” in GIT?
- When we are making the commits, we can make changes to it, format it and review it in the intermediate area known as ‘Staging Area’ or ‘Index’.

Q2 What is the use of a Git clone?
- The Git clone command lets us copy the existing Git repository. 
If we want to get a copy of the central repository then the best way to do it is using ‘cloning’.

Q3 What is the difference between git fetch and git pull?
- Git fetch retrieves new data from a remote repository but does not integrate it into our working files. 
It helps in checking if any changes happened in the remote repository. 
It does not manipulate or destroy anything in the process.

Git pull, on the other hand, updates the HEAD with the latest changes from the remote server and directly integrates it into the working copy files. 
Using git pull can end in merge conflict as it tries to merge remote changes with the local ones.

Q4 What is revert in Git?
- The git revert command is a forward-moving undo operation. 
It is a safe way to undo changes as it will create a new commit that inverses the changes instead of deleting or orphaning commits in the commit history.

Q5 What is GIT stash?
- The Git stash will take the working directory in the current state and index it to put on the stack at a later stage so that what we get is a clean working directory.
This means that if we are in the middle of some task and need to get a clean working directory and simultaneously we want to keep all our current edits, then we can use the Git stash.
